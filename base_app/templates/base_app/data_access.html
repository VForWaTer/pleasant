<!-- Here we only offer the upload button to access data. 
Please be aware that uploading data is a security issue that you have to handle yourself.
Django stores data up to 2.5 megabyte in memory, bigger files in a tmp folder. For details see
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/file-uploads/#where-uploaded-data-is-stored  
Some ideas (in German) about uploading data (and why you shouldn't offer that) are 
available at https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/PHP/Anwendung_und_Praxis/File_Upload 
The better choice for offering data would be a database. -->
